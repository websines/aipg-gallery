# aipg.art production release

Production runs two services behind Nginx from one commit-pinned checkout:

- `aipg-gallery-web.service` - Next.js on `127.0.0.1:3000`
- `aipg-gallery.service` - Go API on `127.0.0.1:4000`

The release host must run the Node 22 LTS line used by `.nvmrc`, Docker, and
CI. Do not build production with a different Node major; wallet packages may
raise their minimum runtime without failing an older npm install.
Backend builds use the Go 1.25 toolchain declared in `server/go.mod`; keep
`GOTOOLCHAIN=auto` enabled so the pinned patch release is selected.

## Durable media recovery (deployed 2026-09-09, 01:49 UTC)

Core PR #149 merged as `bf975599bdfba9fce7b9c661e98331fa3a1aafc1`.
This Gallery candidate depends on its migration 0040 and authenticated
`GET /v1/media/results` endpoint, plus Core PR #150's private
`GET /v1/account/ownership` (merged as
`4891565001ba18ca2bc4b4cfcdb818aeb7da5aeb`). Core is now running that exact
release at Alembic `0040`. Gallery PRs #25/#26/#27 are deployed together as
`c23014761acc14f83030601b5f9bb71311ca6662`, selected through
`/opt/aipg-gallery-current` at `gallery-c2301476`.

Deployment evidence:

- All Gallery PR checks passed: PostgreSQL 16 Go race tests, frontend, browser,
  full-history Gitleaks, and Go/TypeScript CodeQL. The host passed the Node 22
  production build, production-only lockfile reinstall and high/critical
  dependency audit, plus Go race tests, vet and the pinned-toolchain build.
- A fresh local Gallery backup was checksum-verified and restored into a
  disposable database. The candidate's full Go race suite ran against that
  restored database. Existing user, favorite, gallery and generation rows
  matched before/after row-count and content hashes; the first two migration
  checksums were unchanged. Migration 0003 created an empty journal with RLS.
  The scratch database was dropped, and the live schema stayed on two
  migrations throughout the proof.
- New submissions were briefly gated. The old service invocation's journal
  showed zero generation starts and zero terminals; that is an observation,
  not a durable registry or a way to recover pre-release in-memory jobs.
  After switching releases, normal startup applied migration 0003. The live
  first two checksums still match, and the new journal was empty with RLS.
- Both services are active. The running Go executable matches SHA-256
  `7d8ca54b666024d7712249d11c1a66bd2fecce9b60d5d61f00ad81e1d2824601`.
  Environment and final Nginx configuration are unchanged, the temporary gate
  is removed, public Director returns 200, and anonymous credits/recovery
  requests return 401.
- The existing signed-in Google browser session loaded private creations
  after cutover without another login. Nginx recorded successful `/api/auth/me`
  calls after cutover. This is not proof of a wallet-first merge or a funded
  recovery after a generation failure.
- Protected evidence and the fresh backup are retained under
  `/var/lib/aipg-release-proof/gallery-c2301476/`. Retention keeps active
  `c2301476` plus patched rollback `9e7ff3dc`; pruning the older inactive build
  returned free disk space to about 3.6 GB.

Still required before declaring the paid Gallery lifecycle proven: test funded
first-frame and video-stage jobs, then recover their saved handles after a
broker restart. Verify one Core reservation, debit and completion per stage;
replaying an identical request must not generate again. Test live Google/wallet
account-merge recovery as well. No paid generation or credit grant occurred
during this deployment, and global billing/reward gates remain unchanged.

Rollback keeps the new journal and Core reservation/result columns. An older
application cannot recover those new receipts; gate submissions and roll
forward to a repaired reader rather than dropping the journal or retrying jobs.
Recovery does not extend R2 object retention and `closed_without_result` is
not proof of a refund. Do not prune unresolved journal rows.

The client candidate adds browser-persisted pre-submission handles, owner-bound
read-only recovery after a lost 202, and separate Director first-frame/video
associations. A production-build browser test deliberately loses the submission
response, reloads, and recovers the original job with one POST. This is mocked
protocol evidence, not a funded live canary. The account-merge candidate checks
Core ownership before renewing an old session, migrates only proved gallery
owners and browser recovery handles, and reads immutable journal owners through
the same verified family. Reused request IDs across that family return 409;
the original Gallery job ID disambiguates. Core outages preserve the browser's
session markers but fail closed server-side. Test this handoff with live Google
and wallet sessions, plus the funded multistage canary. Deploy the compatible
backend before this frontend; older backend routes cannot recover these handles.
Charging flags and worker payout policy are unchanged by this candidate.

## Earlier patched release (2026-09-08, 23:24 UTC)

- Active commit: `815c11eef601486d83a9c216f63f620bb56d359e` (PR #22).
  Director reload recovery preserves uncertain job identifiers and prevents
  automatic replacement submissions. It does not add durable server-side
  idempotency or prove the paid Director lifecycle.
- Next.js/ESLint `16.3.4` and sharp `0.35.4` pass the production high/critical
  audit gate. Two moderate and one low dependency finding remain.
  Verify sharp with `require("sharp").versions.sharp`; its package exports do
  not permit `require("sharp/package.json")`.
- All PR CI/CodeQL checks passed. The host passed the Node 22 production build,
  frozen production dependency reinstall, Go race tests, vet, and binary build.
  A loopback-only candidate returned 200 for Studio and Director before cutover.
- Both services now run from `gallery-815c11ee`; the Go executable checksum is
  `672a978fbdadb4a8c1c9b3f0c63d4bfd57ea20e625c0e9e9cd747d3e2a195c1e`.
  Shared environment and final Nginx configuration are unchanged. A temporary
  submission gate was removed after the restart and health checks. Anonymous
  credits/jobs return 401; public Studio/Director return 200.
- A fresh browser load restored the signed-in session and existing creation.
  The purchased balance remains approximately `$0.0007`; Krea remains preview
  for this cohort. No new paid canary or global charging activation occurred.
- Host evidence: `/var/lib/aipg-release-proof/gallery-815c11ee/`.
  Core's `deploy/DEMAND_BILLING_LAUNCH_2026_09_08.md` records detailed evidence
  and outstanding cross-site, batch, and Director launch gates.
- The retained earlier releases contain affected image-processing packages.
  Do not blindly restore those dependencies for a UI rollback: preserve these
  patches in a rollback build, or contain the affected surface while repairing
  the patched candidate.

## Earlier billing release (2026-09-08)

- Selected commit: `5836668b91a25cb2a1491af1fca6d8b1fa6d1cb6` (PR #20).
  All PR backend, frontend, browser, security, and CodeQL checks passed.
- The production candidate passed the Node 22 frozen dependency install and
  Next production build, followed by a production-only lockfile reinstall,
  Go race tests, vet, and binary build. No schema migration was introduced.
- Activated `gallery-5836668b`; independently runnable rollback
  `gallery-2bc9c7e6` remains retained. Environment hash was unchanged before
  construction and after activation; service definitions and Nginx were not edited.
- Both processes are active, the backend process directory matches the new
  release, and `/proc/<pid>/exe` matches the candidate binary SHA-256
  `04a9f9d9094de2494ee612387eb74dec4b58cd5a17af6b725b94aab0249b381d`.
  Public `/create` returns 200; anonymous `/api/credits` returns 401.
- A real signed-in Google session survived a fresh page load. The persisted
  private canary image loaded and the Z-Image quote remained paid. Before this
  release, that canary proved one 3,000-micro-USD purchased debit, one settled
  reservation, and one image completion in Core; a second submission showed
  insufficient credits. The backend release adds response-side account matching.
- This is not global billing activation. Krea remains preview-only for the
  inspected cohort, and other modalities and cross-site identity canaries are
  still outstanding. Detailed economic evidence lives in Core's
  `deploy/DEMAND_BILLING_LAUNCH_2026_09_08.md`.

## Release layout

```text
/opt/aipg-gallery-releases/gallery-<commit>/  # immutable release
/opt/aipg-gallery-current -> ...              # active release
/opt/aipg-gallery/gallery.env                 # shared secrets, mode 0600
```

The environment must set
`MODEL_PRESETS_PATH=/opt/aipg-gallery-current/server/config/model_presets.json`,
`AI_MODEL=auto`, and `RECIPESVAULT_ENABLED=false`. Keep ModelVault enabled for
governance metadata. RecipeVault must remain disabled until its checkpoint names
are migrated to canonical public model aliases.

`AIPG_API_KEY` must be a Core service key bound to service client `aipg-art`
with `account.read`, `inference.submit`, `identity.exchange`, and
`identity.assert`. Configure conservative per-request and daily spend ceilings
in Core. It must not have `inference.service_submit`: every image, video, and 3D
job carries a delegated canonical-user token. Never use an unscoped user key as
the bridge credential.

## Build a release

Resolve and review the exact commit before running these commands. Load
production `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables while building because Next.js embeds them.

```bash
commit="$(git rev-parse origin/main)"
release="/opt/aipg-gallery-releases/gallery-${commit:0:8}"
staging="/opt/aipg-gallery-releases/.building-${commit:0:8}"
test ! -e "$release"
test ! -e "$staging"
trap 'rm -rf -- "$staging"' EXIT
mkdir -p "$staging"
git -C "$staging" init
git -C "$staging" remote add origin https://github.com/AIPowerGrid/aipg-art-gallery.git
git -C "$staging" fetch --depth=1 origin "$commit"
git -C "$staging" checkout --detach FETCH_HEAD
set -a
. /opt/aipg-gallery/gallery.env
set +a
cd "$staging"
test "$(node -p 'process.versions.node.split(".")[0]')" = 22
npm ci
npm run build
npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high
npm ci --omit=dev
(cd server && GOTOOLCHAIN=auto go test ./... && GOTOOLCHAIN=auto go vet ./...)
(cd server && GOTOOLCHAIN=auto go build -o ../gallery-server ./cmd/api)
mv "$staging" "$release"
trap - EXIT
```

## Activate

```bash
ln -sfn "$release" /opt/aipg-gallery-current
install -m 0644 deploy/systemd/*.service /etc/systemd/system/
install -m 0644 deploy/nginx/aipg-gallery.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/aipg-gallery
rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
ln -sfn /etc/nginx/sites-available/aipg-gallery /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/aipg-gallery
systemctl daemon-reload
nginx -t
systemctl restart aipg-gallery aipg-gallery-web
systemctl enable --now aipg-gallery-release-prune.timer
systemctl reload nginx
```

## Verify

```bash
for attempt in $(seq 1 30); do
  curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3000/create/director >/dev/null && break
  sleep 1
done
systemctl is-active aipg-gallery aipg-gallery-web nginx
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:4000/health
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:3000/create/director >/dev/null
curl -fsS https://aipg.art/api/models
curl -fsS https://aipg.art/create/director >/dev/null
test "$(curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' https://aipg.art/audio)" = 404
test "$(curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' -X POST \
  https://aipg.art/api/audio/jobs)" = 404
systemctl is-enabled aipg-gallery-release-prune.timer
systemctl is-active aipg-gallery-release-prune.timer
```

Then run one authenticated Director canary. Confirm the result URL is readable,
the completed job survives a fresh status request, and Core records exactly one
completion ledger row for the Grid job ID. When charging is enabled, also
confirm one settled reservation and the expected credit delta. A canary without
uploaded audio may still contain model-generated audio.

After the new release and rollback are proven, run
`systemctl start aipg-gallery-release-prune.service`. The daily timer repeats
the same active-aware retention policy and keeps exactly one inactive rollback.
The dot-prefixed staging path is intentionally outside the pruner's
`gallery-*` namespace, so an interrupted clone or build can never displace a
runnable rollback.

## Roll back

Before selecting a prior release, check its dependencies against current
security gates. Do not restore the pre-`815c11ee` affected Next.js/sharp packages.
Prepare a reviewed rollback candidate retaining the security patches when the
previous release is affected. Then point `/opt/aipg-gallery-current` to that
candidate, restart both services, and repeat the smoke checks. Do not roll back
by copying individual files into the active checkout.
