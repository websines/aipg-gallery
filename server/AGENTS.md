# server — Go API server (grid broker, gallery, auth)

## Purpose

The backend (chi router, Go ≥1.24). The only component that talks to the grid, the on-chain
vaults, Cloudflare R2, and Postgres. Brokers image, video, and 3D generation jobs,
serves the gallery + media, validates auth sessions, runs Google One Tap sign-in, and proxies prompt enhancement.
Entry point: `cmd/api/main.go`; all routes + HTTP handlers live in `internal/app/app.go`.

## Ownership

- `cmd/api/main.go` — process entry: loads `.env`, builds `app.App`, serves `cfg.Address`.
- `internal/app/app.go` — the router + every HTTP handler (~2K LOC god-file). Routes under
  `/api`: auth (`/auth/google`, `/auth/logout`, protected `/auth/me`, Google linking, and wallet linking), `/models`, `/styles`,
  `/ai/enhance`, `/jobs`, public `/gallery` reads, and JWT-protected
  gallery/favorites reads and writes. Protected `/gallery/me` is the identity-neutral private gallery
  read path. CORS + IP rate limits (100/min global, 20/min on job create).
- `internal/config` — typed `Config` + `Load()` (all env reads live here).
- `config/model_presets.json` — local model defaults/limits merged with on-chain models.
  Create-page UI models come from repo-root `../config/styles.json`; startup discovers it
  from either the repo root or `server/`, and `STYLES_CONFIG_PATH` can override discovery.

## Local Contracts

- **One handler file:** routes and handlers stay in `internal/app/app.go`; provider logic stays
  in its `internal/*` package. Env reads only in `internal/config`.
- **Graceful degradation:** ModelVault, RecipeVault, and R2 are optional and fail soft. PostgreSQL
  is different: when `POSTGRES_ENABLED=true`, it owns user and gallery persistence and must start
  successfully. Connection or migration failures stop startup rather than silently switching stores.
- Core `/v1/status/models` determines live capacity. Local presets provide UX
  shape and ModelVault enriches metadata. RecipeVault filtering is disabled by
  default until its raw checkpoint names are migrated to canonical public model
  aliases.
- **Auth:** the Go server brokers both proof paths to Core: `/auth/google`
  forwards the Google ID token, while `/auth/wallet/challenge` and
  `/auth/wallet/exchange` proxy Core-issued SIWE without exposing the Gallery
  service key. The server derives `wallet:<address>` itself; it never accepts an
  app subject from the browser. Successful proof mints the httpOnly `aipg_auth`
  cookie with the canonical Core account id and short-lived step-up token.
  Before issuing or renewing that session, the server atomically canonicalizes
  gallery rows and favorites from the login aliases actually proved in that
  request. Google-only proof must not infer a wallet; wallet-only proof must not
  infer a Google subject; the link path may migrate both. Once linked, Core's
  Google exchange returns the primary verified wallet so later Google sessions
  retain the established link without another signature.
  Protected `/auth/link-google` is the symmetric wallet-first path: the wallet
  session supplies one proof, the Google ID token supplies the other, and the
  server sends Core a server-derived `wallet:<address>` app subject. Never
  accept that merge subject from the browser. The linked Gallery session keeps
  that specifically proved address even if Core reports another primary wallet
  on a canonical account with multiple wallets.
  Local-only login is fail-closed. The server validates cookies on protected
  routes via `authMiddleware` (Bearer fallback), serves `/auth/me` and
  `/auth/logout`, and enforces the Origin allowlist on cookie mutations.
  `jwt.go` verifies HS256 with a constant-time compare + explicit `alg` check.
  Cookie attributes come from `AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN` / `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE` (Secure auto-set for
  HTTPS). There is intentionally no Go wallet `/auth/verify` (removed dead, replay-prone path).
- The Gallery `users.wallet_address` column is nullable because Google and
  wallet are independent login methods. Versioned SQL in
  `internal/gallery/migrations/` is the database source of truth and repairs
  legacy `NOT NULL` schemas before Google-only profiles are written. `users.id`
  is a Postgres UUID and must remain a string in Go storage types and queries.
- Private gallery reads use protected `/gallery/me`; the legacy wallet path is owner-checked.
  Never expose unpublished prompts or media through an unauthenticated wallet lookup.
- Gallery items, favorites, and pending jobs are owned by the normalized Core
  account ID. Login-method keys are compatibility aliases for one-time,
  proof-backed migration only and must not be used for new writes.
- **Trust nothing from the client:** `CreateJobRequest.Validate()` enforces hard caps (`n`,
  steps, dimensions, prompt length). `allowedOrigins()` fails closed — never returns `*`;
  production MUST set `GALLERY_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
- **Grid passthrough:** generation goes through `internal/aipg` to the grid **`/v1`**
  (`POST /v1/images|videos|3d/generations`, synchronous; the legacy horde `/api/v2` is RETIRED —
  410 Gone). `internal/app/pendingstore.go` bridges the gallery's async `POST /api/jobs`
  and poll contract onto the synchronous grid call. The server holds the grid key, the
    client never does. Config paths are CWD-relative (`config/styles.json`,
    `./config/model_presets.json`) — run the server from the repo root.
- `/api/models` preserves Core's recipe-derived generation modes when present;
  preset capabilities are a compatibility fallback, not authority to execute a workflow.
- Jobs, prompt enhancement, and credits require the session cookie. The server
  exchanges its server-derived namespaced local subject through a scoped service account and
  sends the resulting short-lived `X-Grid-User-Token`; request bodies never
  supply a Grid key. The `aipg-art` key requires `account.read`,
  `inference.submit`, `identity.exchange`, and `identity.assert`; it is bounded
  by Core service spending ceilings and must not carry
  `inference.service_submit`. Image, video, and 3D generation are all delegated
  to the authenticated canonical user. A service exchange whose Core
  `account_id` differs from the signed Gallery session fails closed before any
  credit read, quote, enhancement, or generation. Pending job status is
  owner-bound.
- `POST /api/credits/quote` maps the local catalog model and duration to Core's
  canonical quote endpoint. Job creation repeats that preflight for immediate
  insufficient-credit UX, but Core's atomic reservation remains authoritative
  against balance races.
  Credit summaries and quotes must also return the exact delegated canonical
  account ID. Missing or mismatched IDs fail closed with a bounded gateway
  error; job creation must not enqueue background generation in that case.
  This applies equally to Director first frames and video segments.
- Successful Core media responses persist `grid.job_id` as nullable
  `gallery_items.grid_job_id`; this receipt identifier is distinct from the
  Gallery's polling/publishing `job_id`.
- Standalone music belongs to `aipg.music`; this service intentionally exposes
  no ACE-Step or `/api/audio/jobs` surface. Director timeline audio remains
  embedded in video requests.
- Image/video generation uses the shared `aipg.MediaGenerationTimeout`
  deadline, currently 11 minutes so it remains beyond Core's 10-minute video
  ceiling. Keep the detached job context and HTTP client on that same constant.
- **Director timeline passthrough:** `CreateJobRequest.timelineData/localPrompts/segmentLengths/
  guideStrength` forward as `timeline/local_prompts/segment_lengths/guide_strength` on the grid
  request (the wire field is `timeline`, per the grid API guide). Validation: relay strings
  ≤16k chars; timeline ≤25MB and must be valid JSON (it's an opaque blob — media rides inline
  as base64 inside it, so no per-image checks are possible server-side).

## Work Guidance

- New endpoint → register in `app.Router()`, add the handler, wire auth + a rate limit if it
  mutates or hits the grid. Validate request structs.
- New config → add a field to `Config`, read it in `Load()`, document it in `.env.example`.
- New PostgreSQL shape → append an immutable numbered migration under
  `internal/gallery/migrations/`; never edit a migration after it has shipped.
- Anything that mints a JWT must set it via `setAuthCookie` (httpOnly), not return it in the body.

## Verification

- `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto go test ./... && go build ./... && go vet ./...` (toolchain pinned to 1.24).
