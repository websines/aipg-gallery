# components — React UI components

## Purpose

Reusable client UI for the gallery, generation flow, wallet/Google auth, and
layout. Presentation and interaction only; data and auth logic come from `lib/`.

## Ownership

- Auth UI: `account-control.tsx`, `wallet-auth-button.tsx`, `auth-modal.tsx`,
  `social-auth.tsx`, and `google-one-tap.tsx`. Google buttons and One Tap share
  one page-wide GSI initialization. `providers.tsx` wires Wagmi / RainbowKit /
  React Query and reconciles the cookie session on mount; it must never initiate
  wallet connection, network switching, or SIWE.
- Gallery/media: `creation-card.tsx`, `media-card.tsx`, `image-modal.tsx`, `gallery-filter.tsx`,
  `creations-grid.tsx`, `active-jobs-indicator.tsx`. Create flow: `create/*`. Misc: `header.tsx`,
  `network-selector.tsx`, `dimension-slider.tsx`, `error-boundary.tsx`.
- Director onboarding: `create/director/*` exposes one contextual coach mark at a time in the required
  first-render order: add a segment, select it, enter a prompt, generate a private Krea 2 Turbo start
  frame or upload one, then render.
  Coach marks stop after the project has a completed segment.
- Director billing UI shows only Core-owned balances and quotes, links `402`
  recovery to Console funding, and copies only server-observed Core receipt IDs.
- The Jobs menu includes account-scoped unresolved submissions as checking the
  original request, not failed/refunded work. Director source-image replacement
  clears both job and request associations so a late result cannot replace an
  explicitly uploaded frame.

## Local Contracts

- Components consume `lib/` (stores, hooks, `api.ts`) — no direct `fetch` of the Go API, no raw
  token handling. Auth state comes from `useAuthStore`.
- **Auth components must not read or store the JWT** — it's an httpOnly cookie. Use the store's
  markers (address, Google profile) for display and `credentials: 'include'` on any auth fetch.
- A connected wallet under a Google session uses the exact-purpose Core link
  challenge; connecting a wallet alone never silently merges accounts.
- Keep both proof directions in the single account control. It is the user's
  path for linking an existing funded account; hiding either direction creates
  split balances that the user cannot reconcile from the product.
- Logged-out navigation exposes one `Sign in` action. The unified chooser is
  Google-first with wallet providers below it; do not present wallet connection
  as a second competing login. Under a Google session, label the wallet action
  `Link wallet` so its account-merge meaning is explicit. Deduplicate connector
  instances by provider name so WalletConnect appears once.
- Browser-wallet disconnect and AIPG sign-out are separate actions. Neither
  wallet reconnect nor page reload may trigger a signature prompt.
- Wagmi transport reconnect is disabled on mount. The cookie-backed AIPG
  session survives reload independently; reconnect a browser wallet only from
  an explicit sign-in, link, or transaction action.
- An explicit wallet sign-in/link click stores a short-lived, one-use intent in
  session storage so a Base Account login handoff or page remount can finish
  SIWE. Clear it on success, rejection, or expiry; never infer intent from a
  connected wallet alone. A stored intent may run Wagmi's authorization-only
  reconnect when the page mounts or regains focus after a wallet popup. If the
  provider established its own session but is not yet authorized for Gallery,
  return the user to the chooser from that explicit intent instead of requiring
  another top-level click. Without
  that intent, mount and focus remain passive.
- Provider-rendered sign-in controls must measure their container and fit the
  narrow account menu; do not assume a fixed desktop button width.
- Keep the header in its compact menu below the `xl` breakpoint. Authenticated
  account actions and the full navigation must never compete for horizontal
  space at tablet or narrow-desktop widths.
- Keep the gallery filter trigger fixed-size. Its active count is an overlay,
  not content that may resize the search/filter row.
- Source-image controls render only when the selected model declares
  `img2img`/`img2video` (or requires an image). Do not infer support from modality.
- Model controls surface Core-derived offline state, and generation controls
  must not submit a model that is explicitly offline.
- Batch controls render only for a production-certified text-to-image workflow.
  Hide the control when the worker cannot prove requested output cardinality.
- Keep components presentational; push nontrivial logic into `lib/hooks` or `lib/stores`.

## Work Guidance

- New UI → reuse primitives here; add shared state via a `lib/store` and data via a `lib/hook`.

## Verification

- `npm run build` + `npx tsc --noEmit`.

## Child DOX Index

- None — leaf.
