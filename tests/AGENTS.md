# Browser Tests

## Purpose

Production-build Playwright coverage for consumer-facing generation routes.

## Ownership

- `e2e/director.spec.ts` - authenticated keyframe upload and Director timeline
  submission, including the no-client-wallet-identity request invariant,
  first-render onboarding progression/reload recovery, and mobile workspace
  overflow coverage.
- `e2e/navigation.spec.ts` - top-level Director discovery, stable account/auth
  controls across reload, responsive navigation, and the retired
  `aipg.art/audio` route contract.
- `e2e/studio.spec.ts` - authenticated Studio focus/preview pricing, universal
  account-menu and creation-library navigation, mobile overflow, and a lost POST
  response followed by browser reload/read-only recovery with one generation POST.

## Local Contracts

- Browser tests never call live Core, spend credits, or require real wallet or
  Google credentials.
- Mocked API responses must preserve the real Go and Core response shapes.
- Fail on uncaught page errors and unexpected console errors.

## Verification

- `npm run test:e2e`
- `GALLERY_E2E_PORT` selects a free local port (default 3002); use `CI=1` to
  require a fresh production-build server instead of reusing another checkout.

## Child DOX Index

None.
